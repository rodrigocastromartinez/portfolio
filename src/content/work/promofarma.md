In my current role as a mobile developer, I work on Promofarma's mobile app, focusing on the versions deployed in Germany and the Netherlands. These versions feature NFC-based scanning of public health insurance cards, allowing users to access their electronic prescriptions directly in the app. My team owns this functionality, and my day-to-day work includes:

- Building new features based on requirements from various product teams to enhance the overall user experience.
- Integrating analytics and tracking to monitor user behavior, app performance, and production errors.
- Troubleshooting and resolving bugs across all stages of development and production.
- Building and maintaining our Backend For Frontendâ€”an API Gateway that handles communication between the mobile app and backend services.
- Writing tests and reviewing code from other team members.
