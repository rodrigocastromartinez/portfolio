Before transitioning into software development, I worked as a Project Planner and Mechanical Engineer on large-scale industrial projects. My role involved developing comprehensive project schedules, coordinating across multiple disciplines and teams, managing stakeholder communication, and delivering regular progress reports to clients and management. I was responsible for identifying critical paths, mitigating risks, and ensuring projects stayed on track through proactive problem-solving and resource management.

This experience gave me strong foundations in cross-functional collaboration, breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks, working under tight deadlines, and communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. These skills have proven invaluable in my development career, particularly when leading projects, coordinating with product teams, and managing releasesâ€”translating seamlessly from engineering project management to agile software development environments.
