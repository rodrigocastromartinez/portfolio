FARO is a sophisticated full-stack web application designed for real estate professionals to create, manage, and share interactive property catalogs. Built with modern web technologies, this platform provides an intuitive content management system for real estate marketing materials with advanced image handling capabilities and secure sharing mechanisms.

The application is architected using Next.js 13 with the experimental App Router, leveraging React 18's latest features for optimal performance and developer experience. The frontend utilizes TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, while implementing Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first styling. The authentication system is powered by NextAuth.js with custom Firebase authentication integration, providing secure email/password authentication with session management. The application features a custom React Context for global authentication state management, ensuring secure access control throughout the platform.

The backend infrastructure is built on Firebase's comprehensive ecosystem, utilizing Firestore as the primary NoSQL database for real-time data synchronization and Firebase Storage for scalable image management. The data architecture follows a hierarchical model with Users, Catalogs, Pages, and Images entities, where each catalog can contain multiple customizable page types including location descriptions, property characteristics, pros/cons analysis, and various image gallery layouts (4, 5, or 6 image configurations). The API layer implements a clean separation of concerns with dedicated TypeScript modules for business logic, including comprehensive CRUD operations, image upload/download functionality, and advanced features like page positioning and batch operations with Firestore transactions.

Key technical features include real-time image upload with Firebase Storage integration, dynamic page templating system with multiple layout options, encrypted URL generation using Node.js crypto module for secure catalog sharing, optimized image handling with Next.js Image component and remote pattern configuration, comprehensive error handling with custom error classes (AuthError, DataError, ProcessError, UnexpectedError), and real-time data synchronization across all connected clients. The platform also implements advanced UX patterns such as debounced input handling for real-time updates, modal-based workflows for content creation and deletion, drag-and-drop style page reordering, and responsive design principles ensuring optimal performance across all device types. The application is deployed on Vercel with automatic CI/CD integration and includes comprehensive TypeScript configuration for enhanced code quality and development experience.
