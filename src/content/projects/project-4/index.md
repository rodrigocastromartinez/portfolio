I designed and developed a comprehensive web application and Back Office platform using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, transforming the creation and distribution of personalized real estate catalogs. The solution features a cloud-native architecture leveraging Firebase as the primary backend and Firebase Storage for scalable asset management. I implemented a robust multi-tenant authentication system with Firebase Auth, providing granular access controls and ensuring data security for multiple clients. The platform enables seamless generation of real estate catalogs with automatic database storage and effortless sharing via secure links. Additionally, I integrated advanced features such as dynamic catalog generation, third-party API integration, and performance optimizations to ensure fast multimedia content loading and an efficient user experience.
