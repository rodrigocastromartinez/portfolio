Iris New Product is a mobile application built using Expo (SDK 52), a React Native-based framework, specifically designed for Galician firefighter teams. In this project, I have been responsible for making key decisions such as selecting the development framework and defining the styling approach, including the adoption of react-native-paper to implement Material Design components. My role also encompasses bug fixing, leading the development of new features, and driving design enhancements, all while upholding high standards of clean, well-structured, and efficient code. Additionally, I oversee the ongoing maintenance of the Azure code repository, ensuring effective and seamless collaboration within the development team.
